[Dibi](http://dibiphp.com) - smart database layer for PHP
=========================================================

Database access functions in PHP are not standardised. This library
hides the differences between them, a above all, it gives you a very handy interface.

The best way how to install Dibi is to use a [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/download):

    php composer.phar require dibi/dibi

Or you can download a latest package from http://dibiphp.com. In this
package is also `Dibi.minified`, shrinked single-file version of whole Dibi,
useful when you don't want to modify library, but just use it.

Refer to the `examples` directory for examples. Dibi documentation is
available on the [homepage](http://dibiphp.com).

Dibi requires PHP 5.2.0 or later. It has been tested with PHP 5.5 too.
